                                               ABSTRACT
This project aims to develop an effective Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system
by leveraging the capabilities of the Librosa library for audio analysis in Python. The
system focuses on identifying and classifying human emotions from audio recordings
using simple machine learning techniques and signal processing methods. The
approach includes data collection, pre-processing, feature extraction, model training,
and evaluation. Key algorithms and technologies include acoustic features like Mel
Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, and mel-spectrograms,
alongside simpler machine learning models such as Decision Trees and Support Vector
Machines (SVMs) to capture patterns in speech. Librosa is utilized for loading audio
files, pre-processing, and extracting relevant features. The project's simplicity and
efficiency make it distinct from existing SER systems, as it focuses on straightforward
algorithms and leverages the modular and readable code of Librosa, making it  easy
to implement and understand. Evaluations are conducted using standard datasets like
RAVDESS to ensure robustness across diverse speakers and contexts, with metrics
including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Results demonstrate that the SER
system, using Librosa, achieves high accuracy and reliability, showcasing its potential
for real-time emotion recognition applications.

   ###  USE CASES
1. **Customer Service & Call Centers**  
   - SER can detect customer emotions during interactions, helping support agents respond better.  
2. **Healthcare & Mental Health Monitoring** 
   - Helps in early detection of depression, stress, and anxiety through voice analysis.  
3. **Virtual Assistants & Chatbots**  
   - Enhances AI assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri to respond more empathetically.  
4. **Education & E-learning**  
   - Monitors students' engagement and emotions during online learning sessions.  
5. **Entertainment & Gaming**  
   - Adjusts in-game environments and NPC (Non-Player Character) responses based on player emotions.  
6. **Security & Forensic Analysis**
   - Assists in criminal investigations by analyzing emotional cues in voice recordings.

### IMPLEMENTATION
The system is implemented using the Librosa library in Python for audio processing, along with machine learning models for classification. The process includes:

1. **Data Collection**
   -Using datasets like RAVDESS, TESS, CREMA-D, or EmoDB for training and evaluation.
2. **Pre-processing**
   -Noise reduction, silence removal, and normalization of audio signals.
3. **Feature Extraction**
   -Using MFCCs, chroma features, and mel-spectrograms to analyze speech patterns.
4. **Model Training & Classification**
   -Applying Decision Trees, SVMs, or Deep Learning (CNN, LSTMs) to classify emotions.
5. **Evaluation & Performance Metrics**
   -Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure model effectiveness.
